ðŸš€ Just built a sleek, modern Login Page using ONLY HTML & CSS!

No frameworks. No JavaScript. Just clean, HAND-written code (yes that's true) and a lot of creativity! ðŸ’»ðŸŽ¨

This wasnâ€™t just about making a form â€” it was about crafting a user-friendly and visually appealing interface from scratch.

Hereâ€™s what I discovered through this mini project:

CSS is an art â€” with the right spacing, shadows & curves, everything pops
Creating depth with shadows, gradients, and border-radius.
Managing spacing with padding, margin, and alignment

ðŸ“¸ Sharing a glimpse of it right here !!!!
